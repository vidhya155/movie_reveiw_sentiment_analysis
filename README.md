We are going to implement Natural Language Processing based project. The project is Movies Reviews Sentiment Analysis who classify that the given review about the movie is a positive review or a negative review. So we train our model on the movies reviews dataset and use that model for implement end to end application. End-to-end means we deployed this model using the Python Framework flask on the localhost. And also try to deploy on the heroku. So we use a naive-bayes algorithm to train our model, this is the probability based algorithm.

So we are going to train our model with the help of following steps:

<p>-> Import required libraries</p>
<p>->load the data</p>
<p>->Perform EDA</p>
<p>->Remove stop words and  apply stemming</p>
<p>-> Convert the text data into vectors</p>
<p>-> Split data into training and testing</p>
<p>-> Define our model</p>
<p>-> Test the model on testing data</p>
<p>->Check the accuracy</p>
<p>->Test on the custom data</p>

We have also deployed this model using the python framework flask, which provide some tools for the web development. 
This is the simple GUI of application, Where a user is provided to type some random review and by clicking on predict the application gives you the sentiment of the user review whether it is a postive or negative review.
